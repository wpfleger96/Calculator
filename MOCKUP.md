# GUI Mockup

Modify this document to include information about your GUI mockups. You should
upload your mockup images to an image hosting site (e.g., 
[imgur](http://imgur.com/)), and include them in this Markdown document with 
descriptions. Let the rest of this document serve as an example.

**Note:** If you view this <code>MOCKUP.md</code> file on GitHub, the Markdown
syntax will automatically be rendered so that it looks nice in your internet
browser. You need click on the <code>Raw</code> button in the upper
right-hand side of the document (when viewing on GitHub) in order to view the
plain text version of the document. This plain text view is the same thing
you will see when editing your <code>MOCKUP.md</code> file using Emacs
or Vi.

**Note:** For more information on Markdown syntax, see the
[Markdown Syntax Documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and the help page for 
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
